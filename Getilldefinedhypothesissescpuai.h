//the main algorithm is only aware of those three numbers of line of codes: 15, 5 and 100. 
//100 line of code could be erronous although. 
//to keep track of futur line of codes, its better to use 17 hypothesises
//. abstract object olatonicism dont exist here, then cpu pointers are safe if the cpu is using 100 registers
//because clock is unsafe. to get safety we need algebraic topology formulas then
//this is ill defined.
